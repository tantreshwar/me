 <h2><a href="RWMS.pdf">Rainwater Management System (Data Structure+IoT based+ DBMS):</a></h3>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">The main concept is to operate the water pipe network,such that the area having less water can get water from area having sufficient amount.So here with Djikstra Algorithm we find the shortest path to tank where ample amount of water is there.</font></p>
 <br>
 <h2><a href="Intelligent Heating Systems.pdf">Intelligent Heating System (GUI based+IoT based+ DBMS+ Prediction Algorithm):</a></h3>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">The main idea is that whenever a user goes to bathroom, he will find water heated perfectly to the temperature he likes. To operate remotely IoT concept is used.</font></p>
 <br>
 <h2><a href="Outbreak Alert System.pdf">Outbreak Alert System (IoT based+ Data Structure+DBMS+Comp.Networks):</a></h3>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">This project is inspired from Covid-19 cases in India however it could be used for giving updates for any kind of outbreak.The data for patients is stored in form of hash table. From database using CSMA CD Non persistent protocol data is transmitted about outbreak via Internet and it messages user via Telegram.</font></p>
 <br>
 <h2><a href="Self-Balancing Bot.pdf">Self-Balancing Bot (Control System based):</a></h2>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">The project aimed at designing a bot that can balance itself on two wheels. The bot is wirelessly controlled using XBee module. The controller was implemented on Arduino.</font></p>
 <br>
 <h2><a href="Commsys.pdf">Communication System (IoT based + Signal Processing):</a></h2>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">The project aimed at implementing transfer of analog signal from electronic device via internet to receiver computer using digital communication. The programming language used was MATLAB.</font></p>
 <br>
 <h2><a href="TAS.pdf">Train Automation System (IoT based):</a></h2>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">The project aimed at automation of Railway gates, indication of break in railway tracks and in emergency alarm will be raised at station in vicinity via internet also the signals will automatically turn red.</font></p>
 <br>
 <h2><a href="Temp.pdf">Temperature Control (IoT based):</a></h2>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">The project aimed to monitor the temperature of the material using LM35 sensor. In case of out of range temperature the buzzer will switch on also message will be sent to monitoring station through internet.</font></p>
<br>
<h2><a href="cric.pdf">Cricket Game (GUI based+DBMS):</a></h2>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">It is a GUI application. The project aims at calculating the total point scored for selected players in a user defined team. Language used was Python and database management software used was MySQL.</font></p>
 <br>
 <h2><a href="ARS.pdf">Aircraft Reservation System (GUI based+DBMS):</a></h2>
 <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">It is a GUI application. The project aims at developing the booking and cancelling of flight tickets.Concept used is that a database is maintained of flights and tickets are booked, through which
booking and cancelling is done.</p></font>
